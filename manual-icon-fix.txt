MANUAL FIX FOR ANDROID LOGO ISSUE

The issue is that you have a native Android project, which means the app.json config is being ignored for icons. The Android build process is using the native icon files located in the android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-* directories.

OPTION 1: Manual replacement (quickest solution)

1. Use an icon generator tool like https://easyappicon.com/ to generate Android icons from your logo.png
   - Upload your logo and download the Android icon set
   - Make sure to select "adaptive icons" option if available

2. Replace the files in these directories with your generated icons:
   - android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-mdpi/
   - android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-hdpi/
   - android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xhdpi/
   - android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxhdpi/
   - android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/

3. Replace these files in each directory:
   - ic_launcher.webp (main app icon)
   - ic_launcher_round.webp (rounded version)
   - ic_launcher_foreground.webp (foreground for adaptive icons)

4. Rebuild your APK with:
   npx eas build -p android --profile apk

OPTION 2: If you prefer using Expo's config system

1. Delete or rename the android/ directory temporarily
   - This will force Expo to use your app.json configuration
   - Rename it to android-backup/ so you can restore it if needed

2. Rebuild your app:
   npx eas build -p android --profile apk

3. This will generate a new android/ directory with the correct icons based on your app.json

Note: This approach might lose any custom native Android code you've added, so only use if you don't have significant native customizations.
